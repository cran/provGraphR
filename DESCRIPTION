Description: Creates and manages a provenance graph corresponding to the 
    provenance created by the 'rdtLite' package, which
    collects provenance from R scripts.  'rdtLite' is available on CRAN.
    The provenance format is an extension of the 
    W3C PROV JSON format (<https://www.w3.org/Submission/2013/SUBM-prov-json-20130424/>).
    The extended JSON provenance format is described 
    in <https://github.com/End-to-end-provenance/ExtendedProvJson>.
